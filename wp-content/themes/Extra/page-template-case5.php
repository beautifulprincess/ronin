				<div class="case-title1">Problem:</div>
				<div class="case-title2">Managing service outages during times of emergency can be daunting.</div>
				<div class="case-text">
					<p>Quickly and safely restoring service following major storms and outages is critical to the recovery of the affected service area. Managing the restoration efforts is daunting, even for well-prepared electric, gas and communications utilities. Challenges include marshaling emergency responders; managing external crews and contractors; and interfacing with desperate customers.</p>
					<p>These challenges must be addressed in adverse environmental conditions, with the knowledge that each additional minute of outage increased risk to life, limb and property.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="case-title1">Solution:</div>
				<div class="case-title2">Ronin empowers utilities to tackle restoration challenges by significantly improving their situational awareness.</div>
				<div class="case-text">
					<p>Ronin provides operations centers real-time visibility of locations and dispositions of work crews, assets and resources on a service area map. Managers can task and communicate with crews in the field directly though the map interface.
