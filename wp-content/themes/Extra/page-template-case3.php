				<div class="case-title1">Challenge:</div>
				<div class="case-title2">Lack of operational visibility.</div>
				<div class="case-text">
					<p>The transportation and logistics industries depend on consistent and reliable delivery of product to customers.  Supply chain complexity and a myriad of disconnected systems to manage driver schedules, truck maintenance and compliance reporting make it a challenge to ensure all deliveries are on time and in full. </p>
					<p>Lack of operational visibility can inhibit a company’s ability to drive operational efficiency and to tackle new business trends.  Any breakdown can halt revenue and torpedo customer satisfaction, sometimes for the long-term.</p>
					<div class="case-title2">Common Concerns:</div>
					<ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Are there adequate drivers and trucks to cover today’s routes?</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Are there any missed deliveries? Are any deliveries at risk?</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">A truck is down. Where is the nearest truck that can assist?</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Are we prepared for inspection?</p></li></ul>
				</div>
				<div class="case-title1">Solution:</div>
				<div class="case-title2">Real-time data visibility with a common operational picture.</div>
				<div class="case-text">
					<p>Ronin answers these logistics questions by providing a real-time operational picture of the distribution network.  Logistics managers and drivers, and even retail sites (customers), are linked together with their own views of the same information.  Everyone can see the status of deliveries, get notifications of problems and act before delivery times are missed.  Managers can confidently reroute drivers, make informed decisions and be certain they are in regulatory compliance.</p>
					<p>The Ronin Platform is an intelligence layer that connects with existing management systems to pull relevant data. Ronin then employs existing workflows to deliver information to users in the context of their location and role.</p>
					<p>Ronin’s mobile-first, map-driven interface allows users to instantly visualize critical data, and act on it.  Users can communicate with one another directly through the interface via chat,  images, video or on-screen annotations.  Everyone has visibility with a common operational picture.</p>
