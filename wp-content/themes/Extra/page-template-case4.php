					<p>Most security systems today, react to alarms or calls to initiate an investigation after an incident has occurred. Many of these systems use a limited communication network to notify those affected. These systems typically only perform one task and do not communicate or collaborate with other technology or agencies under your security environment.</p>

						<p><strong>Campus Security</strong></p>

				<div class="case-title1">Scenario:</div>
				<div class="case-text">
					<p>A student is walking alone on campus at night. They feel uncomfortable because someone is following them. They don’t want to call 911. But they would like to know of a safe place to go or if there is a security guard nearby.</p>
					<p>With the Ronin Platform, campuses are armed with a complete security solution including apps on student and faculty mobile devices, location maps, real-time chat sessions to decrease resolution time and to create safer outcomes.</p>
					<p>If our student had the Ronin app on their phone, they could trigger a “soft” alarm to alert campus security to their location and their concerns.  With Ronin, the communication doesn’t stop there. The security ops center can immediately respond to the student via text and can answer their questions or concerns until they are out of harm’s way.</p>
					<p>In addition, the Ronin Platform provides the entire security team with a common operational picture centered around geospatial mapping and real-time access to sensors and communication. Now the security ops center can instantly locate the nearest patrol, and they can activate cameras or lights in the student’s area. Security can even telestrate over a map or image to quickly draw a route to safety for the student, helping them find a safe place to stay until the patrolman arrives.</p>
