				<div class="case-title2">Multiple systems with limited communication between them.</div>
				<div class="case-text">
					<p>There is a rapidly increasing array of single-function security systems in the market today. These ‘point solutions’ address one to two functions of public safety with limited flexibility and visibility to other security solutions or legacy systems. It falls to event organizers to manually connect data from these disparate systems and then communicate that data to their varied security teams. Most security systems also rely on alarms or calls to initiate an investigation after an incident has occurred. These systems do not communicate or collaborate with other technologies or agencies in the security environment.</p>

					<p>The Ronin Platform is a situational awareness delivery platform that can transform the way security organizations respond, support and manage their public safety environments. Ronin integrates video, sensors, and people to create proactive problem resolution. The Ronin Platform is a force multiplier that allows security organizations to leverage and connect all of their existing security technology into one common operating picture delivering real-time information and bi-directional communications providing a clear picture of any incident under your command. Ronin can integrate and aggregate everything you already have--data from the IoT, your sensors and legacy systems, and your people--to allow for meaningful, real-time decision making.</p>

				<div class="case-title1">Scenario:</div>
				<div class="case-text">
					<p>An outdoor/indoor event drawing thousands of people requires intricate security planning since priority number one is to ensure all guests arrive and return home safely. The Ronin Platform provides the entire security team with a common operational picture centered around geospatial mapping and real-time access to sensors and communication. Now the security ops center can instantly locate the nearest patrol and can activate cameras or lights in the venue. Security can even telestrate over a shared map or image to quickly draw a route to safety for the attendees.</p>
					<p>The monitored security perimeter can extend to outside the venue to parking lots and mass transportation stops, linking in officers from local law enforcement entities as well as their camera feeds and security infrastructure.</p>
					<p>Any guest can not only request assistance and be directed to the nearest security staff member or safe place but also report issues or unsafe conditions as a “see something, say something” program, extending your security surveillance capabilities. Guests can send messages, pictures and videos, all tagged with location and time.</p>
					<p>Venue security teams will decrease resolution time and create safer outcomes when all security staff are armed with the Ronin Platform as a complete security solution with a common operational picture.</p>
